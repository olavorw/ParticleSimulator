# Particle Simulator
*Fun particle nerdy science stuff visualized!*

In more words, this script has some cool visualizations made in python with particle stuff like particle accelerators, particle collisions, and particle physics. It's a fun little project that I made to learn more about particle physics and python. Also, some other random science nerd visualizers and other stuff resides here as well.
